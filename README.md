### ðŸš€ What I'm Working On

#### Trade Tracker Application ðŸ“Š
A sleek and responsive trade tracking platform with an **Express backend** and a **React frontend**. It currently interfaces seamlessly with **TradeZero accounts**, and it's designed for easy adaptation to other account types. I initially built the backend, but decided to build the frontend as a learning experience with React.

- **Try It Out**: [Trade Tracker](https://tradetrackerfrontend-production.up.railway.app/) **(Username: TestUser | Password: adminadmin)**

- *Please note*: The application is in beta. It is optimized for desktop and tablet use. Mobile responsiveness is a work in progress, and you may encounter layout issues on smaller screens after logging in. Iâ€™m actively working on these improvements. If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute to the mobile-responsive design, your feedback and contributions are highly welcome and appreciated!
