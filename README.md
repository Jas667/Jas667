#### Trade Tracker Application ðŸ“Š
A sleek and responsive trade tracking platform with an **Express backend** and a **React frontend**. It currently interfaces seamlessly with **TradeZero accounts**, and it's designed for easy adaptation to other account types. I initially built the backend, but decided to build the frontend as a learning experience with React.

- *Please note*: The Trade Tracker is currently in beta. It is optimized for desktop and tablet use, and we're working hard to improve the mobile experience. If you encounter any layout issues on smaller screens after logging in, please know that these are known issues, and fixes are on the way. Your feedback during this stage is invaluable â€” if you have suggestions or want to contribute to the development, especially for mobile responsiveness, don't hesitate to reach out!
