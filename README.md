### üöÄ What I'm Working On

#### Trade Tracker Application üìä
A sleek and responsive trade tracking platform with an **Express backend** and a **React frontend**. It currently interfaces seamlessly with **TradeZero accounts**, and it's designed for easy adaptation to other account types. I initially built the backend, but decided to build the frontend as a learning experience with React.

- **Try It Out**: [Trade Tracker](https://tradetrackerfrontend-production.up.railway.app/) **(Username: TestUser | Password: adminadmin)**

- *Please note*: The Trade Tracker is currently in beta. It is optimized for desktop and tablet use. Your feedback during this stage is invaluable ‚Äî if you have suggestions or want to contribute to the development, especially for mobile responsiveness, don't hesitate to reach out!
