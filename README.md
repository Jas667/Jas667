### üöÄ What I'm Working On

####
Studying Bug Bounty hunting whenever I have time off from the Open Uni. At present I am focusing on client-side bugs.

#### Trade Tracker Application (Completed)üìä
A sleek and responsive trade tracking platform with an **Express backend** and a **React frontend**. It currently interfaces seamlessly with **TradeZero accounts**, and it's designed for easy adaptation to other account types. I initially built the backend, but decided to build the frontend as a learning experience with React.
